# Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis

## Overview

This project applies **Bayesian Change Point Detection** to analyze historical Brent crude oil prices from 1987 to 2022. By combining advanced time series modeling with global event mapping, we aim to uncover **statistically significant structural shifts** in oil prices and correlate them with major geopolitical and economic events.

## Objective

The core objective of this project is to:
- **Detect change points** in Brent oil prices using Bayesian inference (PyMC3),
- **Quantify the statistical impact** of those change points on oil price levels,
- **Map detected changes** to real-world events such as OPEC decisions, economic crises, and geopolitical conflicts,
- **Deliver insights** via a clear, interactive dashboard and concise reports that support business and policy-level decisions.

## Key Features

- üß† **Bayesian Change Point Modeling**: Identify structural breaks and price regime shifts using probabilistic programming.
- üåç **Event Mapping**: Match statistical change points to known historical events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 crash, Russia-Ukraine war).
- üìà **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, stationarity, and seasonality in the oil price time series.
- üìä **Dashboard**: An interactive tool (upcoming) for stakeholders to explore the analysis.
- üìù **Well-documented Reports**: DOCX reports outlining assumptions, methodology, and conclusions.

## Technologies Used
